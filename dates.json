            "testo3": "<li>The total water consumption of AI models is much lower compared to agriculture (about 70% of global water withdrawals) and energy production (about 10-15%), but it can be significant in areas with water scarcity.</li><li>Other large AI models (such as Google's LaMDA) have similar or even higher consumption, although precise data are often not very transparent.</li>"

    "conclusione": {
    "titolo": "Conclusion",
    "testo": "The study shows that the water footprint of AI models like ChatGPT is much lower compared to sectors such as agriculture and energy, but it remains significant, especially where water is scarce. Consumption comes from both data center cooling and the production of energy and hardware. Improving energy efficiency, using renewable sources, optimizing algorithms, and reusing water are effective strategies to reduce this impact. However, more transparency and further research are needed to make AI truly sustainable from an environmental perspective."
